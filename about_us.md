I am a research assistant at the German Department at the University of Graz. I am writing my dissertation on variation in wh-phrases in embedded questions in German.  From 2017 to 2021, I worked in the XPrag.de project “Exhaustiveness in embedded questions across languages”. Beside (embedded) questions my research interests include information structure, scalar implicatures and experimental methodology. I enjoy working experimentally and with corpora.

I am a  doctoral candidate at the linguistics department at Uni Graz. Also, I work as research assistent at the Department for German Studies. aCurrently, I am working in the Project „the erotetic and the aesthetic“, where we want to find out more about suspense in texts. In February of 2021, I graduated from the teachers training program. In my master thesis, I looked at the semantics of the German discourse particles "überhaupt" and "gar". I am very interested in formal semantics and pragmatics as well as their interfaces with syntax.

I study German and Philosophy at Bachelor’s level as well as Physics at Master’s level. Since 2018, I’m a student assistant at the Department of German Studies, where I currently work on an experimental design on the diachronous change of presuppositions.
Further interests and topics I am working on include: formal linguistics in general, syntactical constraints on German evidential, and many aspects of philosophy of language.

## Lea-Sophie Kravanja 
I am a student assistant at the University of Graz and I study German Language and Literature as well as Linguistics in my bachelor’s degree. I am currently working on a corpus-linguistic study that focuses on the use of the definite article with proper names. 
I am interested in a wide range of topics and have therefore yet to decide which ones I will focus on in my upcoming master's degree. Due to working as a student assistent, I have discovered that I enjoy working with corpora and I also like to conduct experiments.

I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor's programme in Linguistics, German Studies and the Master's programme in Technical Physics, as I have finished the Bachelor's programme in Physics in 2021. At the Department of German Studies, I am working as a student assistant on a project that combines game theory and pragmatics. I am also engaged in another project that deals with variant grammar and the geographical evolution of language.
