I am a research assistant at the German Department at the University of Graz. I am writing my dissertation on variation in wh-phrases in embedded questions in German.  From 2017 to 2021, I worked in the XPrag.de project “Exhaustiveness in embedded questions across languages”. Beside (embedded) questions my research interests include information structure, scalar implicatures and experimental methodology. I enjoy working experimentally and with corpora.

I am a  doctoral candidate at the linguistics department at Uni Graz. Also, I work as research assistent at the Department for German Studies. aCurrently, I am working in the Project „the erotetic and the aesthetic“, where we want to find out more about suspense in texts. In February of 2021, I graduated from the teachers training program. In my master thesis, I looked at the semantics of the German discourse particles "überhaupt" and "gar". I am very interested in formal semantics and pragmatics as well as their interfaces with syntax.
