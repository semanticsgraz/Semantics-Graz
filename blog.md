The role of gender in the usage of the definite article with proper names in German

Last week Melanie gave first insights into our research project on the use of definite articles with proper names – click here to read more about it.

We tested a previous work’s hypothesis that there is a difference between the article usage before male and female first names. (Other gender identities cannot be taken into account because our corpus of language data does not provide specific information about this.) Based on our current data, there seems to be little difference between the two genders, both in terms of the usage of a definite article in general (i. e. optional + required definite articles together) and in terms of only the optional usage of a definite article. However, as to the case of the general usage of the definite article an article appears to be used more often with female names in dative. If this difference is statistically significant, we have yet to find out, because we are still calculating our data at the moment. Our working hypothesis is that the use of definite articles often expresses a relationship of proximity but can also have pejorative purposes.
