# These are the current reading groups:

## Formal Semantics
In this quite cozy reading group, we usually meet in a café and discuss one or two chapters of a chosen textbook. 
We started with "Semantics in Generative Grammar" by Irene Heim and Angelika Kratzer. 
Afterwards, we moved to "Logic, Language and Meaning. Vol 2: Intensional Logic and Logical Grammar" by L.T.F Gamut. 
Last semester, we were really dedicated reading "Intensional Semantics" by Kai von Fintel and Irene Heim. Feel free to join, we are always looking forward to meeting new members!

## Theoretical and empirical Linguistics
This is a brand new reading group! Stay tuned for updates.
