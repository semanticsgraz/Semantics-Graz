# These are the current reading groups:

## Formal semantics
In this quite cozy reading group, we usually meet in a caf√© and discuss one or two chapters of a chosen textbook. 
We started with "Semantics in Generative Grammar" by Irene Heim and Angelika Kratzer. 
Afterwards, we moved to "Logic, Language and Meaning. Vol 2: Intensional Logic and Logical Grammar" by L.T.F Gamut. 
Last semester, we were really dedicated reading "Intensional Semantics" by Kai von Fintel and Irene Heim. Feel free to join, we are always looking forward to meeting new members!

## Theoretical and empirical linguistics
This is a brand new reading group! To make it as relevant as possible for the group, Vesela decided that we take turns in chosing a paper we want to read. Feel free to join whenever you can. Contribute with literature YOU are interested in or by joining our interesting discussions. Also, of course, feel free to participate in silence if that is more your style. [Write Vesela an e-mail](mailto:vesela.simeonova@uni-graz.at) and ask to get weekly updates on what we intend to talk about. 


## Theoretical and empirical linguistics - Summer Edition
In the summer, when everyone is on vacation, we intend to deepen our knowledge on one specific topic. Our most recent idea is the availability of De Re vs. De Dicto readings for referential terms. [Write Vesela an e-mail](mailto:vesela.simeonova@uni-graz.at) and ask about the progress.
